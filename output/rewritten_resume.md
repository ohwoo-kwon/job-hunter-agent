To identify and tailor your resume to the best-fit roles, I need three key details:

1. **Seniority Level** (e.g., “Senior”, “Mid-Level”, “Entry-Level”)  
2. **Position Title** (e.g., “Software Engineer”, “Marketing Manager”)  
3. **Preferred Location** (e.g., “New York, NY”, “Remote”)

Please provide those values and I’ll fetch the relevant job listings in JSON format, score each opportunity against your current resume, and then deliver a fully optimized Markdown-formatted resume targeted to your ideal role.
