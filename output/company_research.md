## Role Context and Product Involvement  
**Team & Mission:**  
You’ll join the AI Platform’s Frontend Engineering team, focused on building a high-performance web UI for medical image research & annotation.  

**Product Scope:**  
- Real-time zoom/pan of gigapixel medical images (CT, mammography, pathology slides)  
- Advanced annotation tools (brushes, measurements, labels) akin to Photoshop workflows  
- Data visualization: clinical feeds, analytics dashboards, model metrics  
- Reusable component library (React + Next.js + TypeScript)  

**Collaboration:**  
- UI/UX designers (Figma → React translation)  
- Backend engineers (GraphQL/REST API integration)  
- Product managers & clinical advisors (requirements & prioritization)  
- QA & regulatory teams (compliance, documentation)  

**Tech Stack:**  
React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, CSS-in-JS, HTML5, WebGL/canvas, Webpack/Parcel, npm/yarn, Jest, Cypress, Docker, Kubernetes, Jira/Confluence/Slack  

## Likely Interview Topics  
1. **Frontend Architecture & Performance**  
   - Virtualization strategies for large images (tiling, lazy loading)  
   - WebGL vs. Canvas trade-offs  
   - Next.js data fetching (SSR vs. SSG)  
2. **TypeScript & Code Quality**  
   - Strong typing patterns, generics, discriminated unions  
   - Component design & state management (Context, Redux, Zustand, React Query)  
3. **Testing & TDD**  
   - Unit testing with Jest  
   - E2E flows with Cypress  
   - Mocking WebGL/canvas in tests  
4. **DevOps & Containers**  
   - Local Docker setups, Kubernetes for dev/staging  
   - CI/CD pipelines, deployment on Vercel or Azure  
5. **Domain & UX**  
   - Accessibility & precision in medical UIs  
   - Collaboration with clinicians (usability, compliance)  
   - Handling sensitive data & basic regulatory awareness (FDA/CE)  
6. **Behavioral & Leadership**  
   - Mentoring junior engineers, code review best practices  
   - Communicating in a global, English-first environment  
   - Demonstrating responsible autonomy & decision-making
