# Interview Prep: Lunit – Senior Frontend Developer

## Job Overview
Lunit is hiring a Senior Frontend Developer to join its AI Platform team in Seoul (on-site). You’ll build and maintain high-performance, interactive web interfaces for large medical images—CT scans, mammograms, pathology slides—and advanced annotation tools. This full-time role demands a strong command of React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, module bundlers (Webpack/Parcel), containerization (Docker/Kubernetes) and TDD (Jest/Cypress). You’ll partner with designers, backend engineers, product managers, and clinicians to accelerate AI research and “Conquer Cancer through AI.”

## Why This Job Is a Fit
- **Core Skill Alignment**: You’ve built multiple React/TypeScript applications, optimized performance, and containerized environments with Docker/AWS—directly matching Lunit’s stack.
- **Rapid Learner**: Although you have 3 years of experience (versus the 6+ year ask), your track record of quickly adopting new frameworks and tools (e.g., CI/CD, cloud deployments) demonstrates the growth mindset Lunit values.
- **Passion for Impact**: Your interest in solving real-world problems and delivering high-quality UI/UX maps to Lunit’s mission in medical imaging.
- **Collaboration & Communication**: Proven cross-functional teamwork in multi-cultural settings (Spain/Denmark) and English fluency suit Lunit’s “Global DNA” and inclusive culture.

## Resume Highlights for This Role
- **React & TypeScript Expertise**  
  • Developed 5+ production React apps with TypeScript, improving maintainability and developer velocity  
  • Built a reusable component library (Sass/Tailwind) to accelerate feature delivery  
- **Performance Optimization**  
  • Reduced initial page load times by 30% via code-splitting and asset‐loading strategies  
  • Implemented lazy-loading and virtualization for large data sets  
- **Containerization & DevOps**  
  • Containerized dev/staging environments with Docker; automated deployments with GitHub Actions on AWS  
  • Set up CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistent code quality and zero-downtime releases  
- **Testing & Quality**  
  • Wrote unit tests in Jest and E2E tests in Cypress; championed TDD practices to boost coverage  
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**  
  • Partnered with UI/UX designers to craft responsive, accessible interfaces (40% increase in mobile engagement)  
  • Liaised with backend teams to integrate REST/GraphQL APIs  

## Company Summary
- **Mission & Vision**  
  • Mission: “Conquer Cancer through AI”  
  • Vision: Embed AI into every step of cancer diagnosis and treatment  
- **Product & Market**  
  • AI solutions (INSIGHT CXR, INSIGHT MMG) deployed in 4,800+ institutions worldwide  
  • Real-time zoom/pan of gigapixel images, advanced annotation workflows, clinical data dashboards  
- **Culture & Values**  
  • Growth Excites Us | Responsible Autonomy | Obsession over Timely Craftsmanship | Win as One Team | Talk to Each Other | Respect One Another  
- **Recent Highlights**  
  • May 2024: Acquisition of Volpara Health (breast screening)  
  • Mar 2025: SEHA (UAE) multi-year mammogram analysis contract  
  • Collaboration with Microsoft on Azure scaling; KOSDAQ IPO raising $28M  

## Predicted Interview Questions
1. **Frontend Architecture & Performance**  
   - How would you implement smooth zoom/pan for 10,000×10,000–pixel images?  
   - Compare Canvas vs. WebGL for large-scale image rendering.  
2. **Next.js & Data Fetching**  
   - When would you choose SSR vs. SSG vs. client-side rendering in Next.js?  
3. **TypeScript & Code Design**  
   - Show how you’d type a reusable complex component (generics, discriminated unions).  
4. **Testing & TDD**  
   - How do you mock Canvas/WebGL in Jest tests?  
   - Give an example of an end-to-end test in Cypress for an annotation feature.  
5. **DevOps & Containerization**  
   - Describe your Docker/Kubernetes workflow for local staging.  
   - How have you optimized CI/CD pipelines for frontend delivery?  
6. **Domain & UX**  
   - What accessibility considerations are critical for medical UIs?  
   - How would you validate a new annotation tool with clinical users?  
7. **Behavioral & Leadership**  
   - Tell me about a time you mentored a junior engineer.  
   - How do you manage priorities when scope and deadlines shift?

## Questions to Ask Them
- Team Structure & Workflow  
  • How is the frontend team organized, and which stakeholders will I collaborate with daily?  
  • What does a typical sprint cycle look like, and how is work triaged?  
- Product Vision & Challenges  
  • What are the next high-impact features or performance targets for the AI Platform UI?  
  • Which technical or regulatory hurdles has the team faced recently?  
- Quality & Delivery  
  • What metrics and tools do you use to enforce performance and maintain test coverage?  
  • Can you describe your CI/CD and release process for frontend changes?  
- Culture & Growth  
  • How does Lunit support continuous learning and technical knowledge sharing?  
  • Can you share an example of “Responsible Autonomy” in action on your team?  
- Domain Impact  
  • How do you incorporate clinical feedback into feature design?  
  • Which impact metrics (e.g., model iteration speed, user satisfaction) are most valued?

## Concepts To Know/Review
- Large-image rendering strategies (tiling, virtualization)  
- Canvas vs. WebGL trade-offs  
- Next.js data-fetching methods (getServerSideProps, getStaticProps, ISR)  
- Advanced TypeScript patterns (utility types, generics, mapped types)  
- Jest mocking techniques for browser APIs  
- Cypress for complex UI workflows  
- Docker & Kubernetes basics for frontend environments  
- Accessibility best practices (WCAG) for medical applications  
- Basic FDA/CE compliance considerations  

## Strategic Advice
- **Tone**: Confident, curious, collaborative. Emphasize autonomy while showing openness to feedback.  
- **Focus Areas**:  
  • Performance: demonstrate deep understanding of optimizing large images and UI responsiveness.  
  • Code Quality: highlight TDD mindset and testing strategies.  
  • Domain Awareness: show empathy for clinical end-users and regulatory needs.  
- **Red Flags to Watch**:  
  • Avoid appearing underprepared on WebGL/canvas specifics—practice a sketch on a whiteboard.  
  • Don’t overstate cloud skills—keep examples concrete (Docker, AWS Lambda).  
  • Be ready to explain any experience gaps in seniority by showcasing rapid learning and mentorship potential.  
- **Final Tip**: Tie every technical example back to Lunit’s mission—how your solutions accelerate AI research or improve clinician workflows.
